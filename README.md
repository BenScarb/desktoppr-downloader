desktoppr-downloader
====================

A python script that lets your download wallpapers for any resolution greater than or equal to your own

TODOs
-----
* Read resolution from machine
* Add multi-monitor support
* Make program initialization interactive/parameter based
* Improve image duplication checks (use hashes instead of file names; have contacted the Desktoppr team for this)
